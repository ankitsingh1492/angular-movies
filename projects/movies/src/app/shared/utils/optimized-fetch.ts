/**
 * **ðŸš€ Perf Tip for TTI, TBT:**
 *
 * Avoid over fetching for HTTP get requests to URLs that will not change result quickly.
 *
 * E.g.:
 * Subsequent HTTP get requests to the URLs api/1 -> api/2 -> api/1 can lead to over fetching of api/1 if the first request is still pending.
 * Also the API is not changing that often so we could drop fetche's within a certain timeframe
 * The following logic avoids this.
